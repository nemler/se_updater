Solid Edge Automatic Updater

This is sample code in VB.Net to show how you can create an application for Siemen's Solid Edge to automatically update the options.xml file on boot up, install the latest maintenance pack, and update a list of files from a server location.

This program is designed to be used as a base and not intended to be used as is.
